# Git Commit Message Format Guide!!! 🎉

## Commit Message Structure:
Each commit message should follow this structure: 🧱
`<type>: <short summary line>

<optional detailed explanation (if necessary)>

---

## Commit Message Types:
We use specific types to categorize the changes. Here’s the breakdown of the most common types: 👇

### 1. fix - Bug Fixes 🐛
- Use for commits that address issues or bugs in the code.
- **Example**: fix: correct user login bug 

### 2. feature - New Features ✨
- Use for new functionalities added to the project.
- **Example**: feature: add dark mode toggle 

### 3. docs - Documentation Updates 📚
- Use for commits that modify or add documentation, like README, instructions, etc.
- **Example**: docs: update README with new API examples 

### 4. refactor - Code Refactoring 🛠️
- Use when changing code for improvements, readability, or performance without changing functionality.
- **Example**: refactor: improve login component readability <0xF0><0x9F><0xA7><0xBD>

### 5. chore - Routine Tasks 🧹
- Use for non-feature work like setting up tools, CI configuration, or cleaning up.
- **Example**: chore: update project dependencies 

### 6. test - Tests 🧪
- Use for commits related to adding or fixing tests.
- **Example**: test: add unit tests for login form validation 

### 7. style - Code Styling 🎨
- Use for commits that affect only the code style (e.g., formatting, whitespace) and do not affect functionality.
- **Example**: style: format the service request page 

### 8. perf - Performance Improvements 🚀
- Use for commits related to optimizations or performance enhancements.
- **Example**: perf: optimize image loading in the gallery

## Commit Message Format Rules: 🚦

1. **Imperative Mood:** 💪
    - Commit messages should be written in the **imperative mood**, as if you're commanding the changes to be made. This aligns with how Git applies the changes.
    - **Correct**: fix: add user login verification 
    - **Incorrect**: fixed user login verification 

2. **Brief and Descriptive Summary:** 📝
    - The subject line (first line) should be **concise** (around 50 characters or fewer).
    - The summary should be specific enough to describe what the commit does, but not too detailed. Avoid vague messages like "fix bugs." 

3. **Use a Blank Line Between Subject and Body (if needed):** ➡️
    - If your commit requires a detailed explanation, use a **blank line** after the subject and then provide the details.
    - The body should be wrapped at **72 characters** for readability. 

4. **Avoid Ending the Subject Line with a Period:** 🙅‍♀️
    - Commit subjects do not need to end with a period.
    - **Correct**: feature: add map view 
    - **Incorrect**: feature: add map view. 

5. **Keep Commits Focused:** 🎯
    - Each commit should focus on one logical change. Avoid committing unrelated changes together.
    - **Correct**: fix: resolve header alignment issue 
    - **Incorrect**: fix: resolve header issue + add footer component

## 🪴 Git Branching Guidelines

We use a structured naming convention for all feature branches to keep things organized and traceable. Branch names should reflect the type of work and include relevant Jira story numbers. 🌳

### Format:  `feature/<short-description>-<JIRA-IDs>`

### Example: `feature/map-view-CSP-45-46-47`


This indicates a feature branch related to the *map view* that addresses Jira tickets **CSP-45**, **CSP-46**, and **CSP-47**. 🗺️

### 💡 Tips
- Use hyphens to separate words in the description.
- Group related Jira tickets together in the same branch name if they’ll be handled together.
- For bugfixes or other types of work, use prefixes like:
  - bugfix/... 🐞
  - hotfix/... 🔥
  - chore/... ⚙️

Let’s keep the history tidy and easy to follow 🙌
