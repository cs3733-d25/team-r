# Hooks Folder

Custom React hooks go here.

Even though we may not write many custom hooks, itâ€™s helpful to keep them organized in one place.

## Examples:
- `useLocalStorage.ts`
- `useOutsideClick.ts`
- `useDebounce.ts`

> ðŸ§  Tip: Name hooks using the `useSomething` convention and keep them small and focused.
