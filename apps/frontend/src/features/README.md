# Features Folder

Each subfolder here represents a **self-contained feature** or page of the app.

## Structure example:
features/
â”œâ”€â”€ login/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Login.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ mapView/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MapView.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MapControls.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ directory/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Directory.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ serviceReqs/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ServiceReqs.tsx

## Each feature folder may include:
- The main component/view for that route
- Feature-specific components
- Local styles (CSS, SCSS, etc.)
- Services or utilities only used by that feature
- Optional local state management (e.g. context, reducers)

> ğŸ§© Keeping features modular helps with scalability, testing, and code readability.
