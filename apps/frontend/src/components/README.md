# Components Folder

This folder is for **reusable UI components** that are **not tied to a specific feature**.

## Put here:
- Buttons, inputs, modals, dropdowns
- Layout components (Navbar, Footer, etc.)
- Shared form elements or UI utilities

> ğŸ’¡ If a component is only used in one feature (e.g., only in `mapView`), consider keeping it inside that featureâ€™s folder instead.
